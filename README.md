Implement multi-stage builds in your Dockerfile. This involves creating a temporary stage for building your application and then copying only the necessary artifacts
into a final, smaller image with a minimal base. This eliminates unnecessary build tools and libraries from the final image. 

-> Reducing Docker image size speeds up builds, deployments, and saves resources while enhancing security and lowering costs.
